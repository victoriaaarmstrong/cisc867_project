# CISC 867 Final Project Code

This repository contains the code for the CISC 856 Final Project. 

Given the size of the dataset, I couldn't include all of the data used but I've included one batch of images as well as three checkpoints (beginning, midway, end) in case you would like to test anything out. 

The Frechet Inception Distance was calculated using pytorch_fid: https://github.com/mseitzer/pytorch-fid

The base code structure for the DCGAN architecture came from the Pytorch DCGAN Tutorial: https://pytorch.org/tutorials/beginner/dcgan_faces_tutorial.html
